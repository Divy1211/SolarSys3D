# Solar System 3D
1. I have coded a solar system simulator in Processing (a java animations library), my code is a bit messy but i think it will be readable enough. You can run the code in the Processing Developement Environment (PDE) itself.  
2. If you find a bug you can open a pull request

# Prerequisities
1. You should have Java installed.
2. You should also download and install the [Processing Developement Environment](https://processing.org/)

# How the program works

1. It spawns a star with planets and planets may have moons and moons may further have moons uptill any number of specified layers
